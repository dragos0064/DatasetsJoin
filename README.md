# VeridionCH-3
This is the 3rd Challenge of Veridion Task
I strongly believe that the 3rd challenge, the one that I've chosen to tackle, really resonated with me pretty well.  In this Challenge, I tried merging the three 3 CSV given intro a 4th one, firstly, by merging two of them and that result, merged the same with the last dataset. I believe my approach is going to satisfy your expectations.
Most of my approach is commented in the code, so I can better express myself by just work. I had some problems with some double quotes, but still managed to solve them.
I really hope that my project is going to be nice and well-coded.
